Flip Framework
===

Flip Framework is the simplest way to achieve 1-dimensional flip-browsing similar the the behavior found in the popular Flipboard app.  

Lay out your views as normal in the storyboard and with corresponding numbered identifiers.  FlipViewController will allow the user to flip through identifiers (1, 2, 3, 4...) until a view controller with the proper identifier is not found
